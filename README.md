* Duolingo
  * League/Leaderboard
  * Short interactive lessons
  * Skill turning gold after being 'mastered'

I would like to build a Manga tracker app that keeps track of media you have completed, currently reading, interested in, and dropped. Users can make accounts to have the full functionality of the app tracker, but can choose to be a guest user and still be able to search for mangas. Once a user searches for a manga and the cover art along with the title appears, they can tap on it and be taken to the page where relevant information such as the author, description, and previous reviews are displayed for them. If the user is logged in, they can add the media to their reading list and they can also write a review.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
